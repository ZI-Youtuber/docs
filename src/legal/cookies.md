Sargent Coding websites and/or projects may use cookies, local storage, and/or session storage.

## What are cookies?
Cookies, local storage and session storage are key-value pairs saved to your computer for the purpose of remembering things when you exit or change a page. Some types of cookies can expire. Normal cookies expire when they reach their expiry date, session storage expires when the page session ends, and local storage never expires (unless you clear them in your browser).

From now on, we'll use the term "cookies" to refer to cookies and also local storage and session storage.

## What do we use cookies for?
We can use cookies for many things, but we primarily use them to save your preferences and to save your progress. Cookies can also be used to remember what account(s) you are on.

Cookies used on our sites can be categorised based on the ICC UK Cookie guide's Categories of cookies (we currently only use Category 1 and Category 3 cookies):

### ICC UK Cookie guide's Categories of cookies
#### Category 1: Strictly necessary cookies
These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies services you have asked for, like shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.

#### Category 2: Performance cookies
These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a website works.

#### Category 3: Functionality cookies
These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing in a cookie the region in which you are currently located. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.

#### Category 4: Targeting cookies or advertising cookies

They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission.
