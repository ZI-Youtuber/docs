The Unified Website Layout (UWSL) is a design language made to unify the websites of Sargent Coding and its projects. The UWSL allows for the unifaction of the website designing process, making it easy to update the design language across sies easily.

The Unified Website Layout is only intended for internal use.

## Navigation bar

The navigation bar is a section at the top of a page that contains actions and/or navigation links. The navigation bar uses the `<nav>` tag.

### Logo area

The logo area contains the logo of the site. If the site doesn't have its own logo, the logo area should include the site's parent's logo along with text after it. For example, since Sargent Coding's documentation doesn't have its own logo, the logo area should include the Sargent Coding logo followed by the text "Docs".

### Links area

The links area contains links. If two or more links cannot be added to the links area, th links area will be blank. Having a single link in the links area is not allowed.

### Accounts area

The accounts area has two layouts. If the user is logged in, there should only be a profile picture. If there is no user, the accounts area should have a log in link and then a create account button.

## Hero section

The hero section is a section after the navigation bar that contains introductory content. The navigation bar and other elements can also be inside the hero if the hero has its own background. The hero section uses the `<header>` tag.
