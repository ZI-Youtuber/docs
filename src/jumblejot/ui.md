Here's a basic guide to the interface of Jumblejot, and what stuff does.

## Navbar
On the navbar, you'll find a lot of helpful buttons. These include:
- The current file button, which displays the name of your current file, which will close the sidebar
- Centre actions, where you can create new files, rename, export or delete your current file, and also go to the settings
- Your profile picture, which you can log out or view your account using

## Sidebar
Jumblejot has a really cool sidebar that allows you to edit multiple files easier. All files will have an icon next to it, helping you find them easier. On the bottom of the sidebar, there's a storage section which tells you how much storage you have.

## Quick switcher
The quick switcher is a special feature of Jumblejot only accessible by pressing <kbd><span>⌘</span><span>K</span></kbd>. It allows you to search files, actions and words easier, and also has a calculator thinks to the Math.js library.
