**Be kind** Don't bully, abuse or harass other users. We do not condone rude or discriminatory actions.

**Use an appropriate name and avatar** Please try to avoid using special characters, emoji, obscenities in your profile. Impersonation is not allowed.

**Use the chat properly** Do not spam in any channels, as spamming makes everything messy. Use all channels as they are meant to be used (ex: no conversations in #memes). Also, please speak in English, but be considerate of people who speak other languages.

**Don't advertise** Don't advertise if the conversation doesn't pertain to the subject. You are allowed to advertise in #showcase.

**Don't violate people's privacy** Do not expose any other person's personal information (e.g. contact information, passwords) without that person's permission.

**No illegal or disturbing content** Piracy, sexual, gory or otherwise suspicious/illegal/disturbing content is not allowed. We do not condone suspicious or illegal discussions or activity.

**Rules are subject to common sense** These rules may not be comprehensive and the use of loopholes to violate the spirit of these rules is subject to enforcement.
