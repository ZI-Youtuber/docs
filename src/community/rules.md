### 😊 Be kind to other users
Don't harass, abuse or bully other users. We also do not condone rude or discriminatory content.

### 🔤 Use English only
Chat in English, but be considerate of people who speak other languages.

### 🤬 Use an appropriate name and avatar
Please try to avoid using special characters, emoji, obscenities, or impersonation.

### 🔊 Never spam
Spamming makes everything messy. It's also really annoying.

### 🛑 Don't advertise
Don't advertise if the conversation doesn't pertain to the subject. You are allowed to advertise in [#showcase](https://discord.com/channels/872995599979520022/909210629640962149).

### 🏛️ No serious/controversial topics
Please leave that for DMs or somewhere not here.

### 🚓 No illegal or yucky stuff
Piracy, sexual, NSFW, gory, or otherwise suspicious/illegal/gross content is not allowed. We do not condone suspicious or illegal discussions and activity.

### 🔍 Don't violate people's privacy
Do not expose any other person's personal information (e.g. contact information, passwords) without that person's permission.

### 🤔 Rules are subject to common sense
These rules may not be comprehensive and the use of loopholes to violate the spirit of these rules is subject to enforcement.

### 📖 Follow the Discord Terms of Service and Community Guidelines
You must be at least 13 years old to use Discord, and abide by all other terms and guidelines.

If you see any of these rules broken, please consult a moderator, and be sure to send them a screenshot!
